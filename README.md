## Overview

Social App is a web application that allows users to connect, share posts, comment, and interact in a social networking environment. It consists of a client (frontend) and server (backend), working together to provide full stack functionality.

## Features

- User authentication (login, signup)  
- Create, edit, delete posts  
- Commenting on posts  
- Like / unlike posts  
- Possibly real-time updates or notifications (if implemented)  
- Responsive UI for multiple devices  

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend (client):** JavaScript, React (or your front-end library/framework)  
- **Backend (server):** Node.js, Express (or your chosen backend framework)  
- **Database:** (e.g. MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL, etc.)  
- **Others:** JWT (for auth), REST API, any additional libraries/tools  

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version x.x.x)  
- npm or yarn  
- Database setup (if applicable)  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samirAlkassar/social-app.git

    Go to the server folder and install dependencies

cd social-app/server
npm install

Go to the client folder and install dependencies

cd ../client
npm install

Set up environment variables (see Configuration

)

Start the backend server

# from server folder
npm run dev   # or whatever your start script is

Start the frontend client

    # from client folder
    npm start     # or your dev command

Configuration

You’ll likely need a .env file (in server) with settings such as:

PORT=4000
DB_URI=<your_database_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>

(If your client also needs env variables e.g. API URLs, add those similarly.)
Usage

    Navigate to the client in your browser (usually http://localhost:3000

    )

    Sign up or log in

    Create/edit/delete posts

    Comment on posts

    Like/unlike posts
